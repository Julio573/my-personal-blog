# My Personal Blog

a personal blog where I share my thoughts and experiences with games, movies, series, books, anime, and manga. This is a space to talk about the stories, characters, and worlds that have marked me over time.

ps: Still haven't decided the blog's name yet.

For now, I will be using only HTML, SASS and Javascript
